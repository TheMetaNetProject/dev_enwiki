|Comments=The U.S. government is an example (salient subcase) of the Government institution frame. It includes particular structures such as executive, judicial and legislative branches. It is NOT a parliamentary system, where the elected head of state is the majority leader in parliament; instead it is a presidential system.  Frames for these two subclasses should also be created.
