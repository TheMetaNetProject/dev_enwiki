|Comments=Entered per the request after the April 2014 site visit.

This refers to the ideology of freedom, rather than to the physical lack of impediment to motion. This is a target domain frame, whereas the latter is a source domain frame.

It is based on the 7 concepts submitted by us to IARPA in January 2014.

The other 6 are Freedom, Equality, Democratic_institutions, Representation_and_decision-making, Organization_of_power, Citizen_participation.

Lack of impediment to action (“the absence of opposition” as Thomas Hobbs says) as it applies to groups of people in a society or nation. This refers to things such as free speech, free elections, free association.

The scope of freedom of action (i.e. who may have freedom, who typically tends to be excluded from free activities, etc.).

Freedom is often understood as empowerment to seek resources, opportunities, and venues to express opinions.
