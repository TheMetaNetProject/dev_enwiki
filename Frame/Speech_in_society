{{Frame
|Other aliases=Voice in society
|Comments=Created to refer to the 'speech' in 'free speech' and 'we have a voice in society'. Name can be changed (hard to get away from source domain).

This is a TARGET frame; there just isn't a metaphor-free name for it; it's LUs are found in the source in which the metaphor lies (Speaking).

For extraction purposes, LUs such as 'speech' and 'voice' have to be associated with this target frame, in order to extract LMs such as 'freedom of speech', 'have a voice', 'silence our voice' etc. For our purposes, we know these are source terms. 

For this reason, the LUs 'speech' and 'voice' are temporarily here, to be moved once we decide what to do about this problem.
