|Comments=Biological entities can be distinguished from other (non-biological) entities by a cluster of typically-present "properties" relating to their life cycle (birth, growth, development, death), metabolism, and reproduction.  They also tend to have specialized parts and internal mechanisms that fill various functions.  Different kinds of entities (e.g. species) tend to fill particular environmental niches, and can evolve over generations.  Additionally, as with other physical entities, biological entities have size, shape, and other physical properties.
