|Inferences={{Inference
|Inference.Description="Possessing" typically involves the Possessor controlling and/or having access to the Possession. In primary physical experience, the possessor holds/grasps the possessed object.
}}{{Inference
|Inference.Description=If the Possessor does not have control and/or access to an object, the possessor does not possess that object.
|Inference.Type=negation
}}{{Inference
|Inference.Description=In primary physical experience, the physical relation between Possessor and object indicates the status of the possession relation.  Holding and/or grasping (and, more generally, co-location with) the object indicate possession; not holding/grasping indicate lack of possession.  More generally, possession correlates with co-location of possessor and possessed object, and lack of possession with lack of co-location (i.e. some distance between the two)
