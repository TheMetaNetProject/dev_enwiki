Lexical units tend to focus either on change from non-possession to possession (e.g. get, acquire) or on change from possession to non-possession (e.g. lose).  The initial-start-ongoing portion of the x-schema for the current frame captures the first type of change, and the ongoing-finish-final portion of the x-schema captures the second type of change.
