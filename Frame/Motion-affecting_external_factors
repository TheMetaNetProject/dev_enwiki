{{Frame
|Comments=This is a very high level frame. It refers to things/factors/processes/entities/conditions etc. external to a mover or moving entity, that can (either positively or negatively, unspecified) affect the mover's motion (motion here being unspecified as to whether or not it's on a path or goal-directed).

Children of this frame include:
Motion-affecting objects (e.g. burdens and restraints)
Motion-affecting actors (people acting directly on the mover)
Motion-affecting forces (non-agentive, non-entity forces acting on the mover, e.g. winds)
Motion-affecting properties of the landscape (e.g. smooth/rocky paths)

None of these are specified for negative/positive affect or outcome.
Go to each of the above frames for descriptions.

Do not add any more LUs here; rather, add LUs in specific subcases of this general frame.
