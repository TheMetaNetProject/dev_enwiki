{{Frame
|Comments=This is a general frame that encapsulates both: active impediments of any kind (a subframe called Motion_impediments), and FAILURE TO enable (a subframe called Lack_of_enablement).

It refers to impediments in the domain of Motion, as opposed to impediments in the domain of Action. See Impediment_to_action for the latter.

This is a high level frame. Do NOT add LUs here, but either to Motion_impediments or Lack_of_enablement.
