{{Frame
|Comments=One entity (the force_originator) transfers force to another entity (force_reciever), which results in some outcome with respect to one or both enitities.  This is a general frame with more specific subcases that differ as to the intentions of the entities (when sentient), the details of the force-interaction, the relative strengths of the two entities, and the outcomes that result from the interaction.

|Inferences={{Inference
|Inference.Description=The amount of force transferred is correlated with 'force-dynamic properties' of the force_originator, e.g. a person's strength and the amount of effort he exerts.
|Inference.Type=force-dynamic
}}{{Inference
|Inference.Description=The outcome of the interaction will depend on several factors, including the amount of force transferred, the direction of that force, and the (resistant) 'strength' of the force_receiver.
