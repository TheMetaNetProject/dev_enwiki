|Comments=There used to also be an Object_transfer frame (in addition to Gain_possession and Lose_possession). It was unclear how that differed from Transfer_scenario. Object_transfer was deleted, and its LUs are here now. If needed, it can be brought back. It was causing too much confusion. (Oana)
