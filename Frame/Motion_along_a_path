{{Frame
|Description=A moving entity  starts out in one place and ends up in another, having traversed the distance between these places
|FrameNet frame=Motion, Motion_directional, Motion_scenario
|Other aliases=Translational motion, Directional motion
|Comments=A moving entity (the mover) starts out in one place (Source), and ends up in another place (Goal), having covered some space between these two (Path)

I removed the LU 'go' for now (11/7/2014), to help extraction. We can add it back later! (Oana)

}}{{Inference
|Inference.Description=A single mover can only move along one path at a time.  Therefore, motion along a given path means the mover is not following other alternative paths.
}}{{Inference
|Inference.Description=The direction of the mover's motion determines which locations the mover will move to (including the Goal location).
}}{{Inference
|Inference.Description=The mover's mass affects the speed of motion and/or the amount of energy needed for mover to move.  For instance, if mass is increased (e.g. if 'burdens' are added), more energy is required.

There are various ways we might handle 'energy-related' parameters.  The amount of energy might be handled as an x-schema resource and/or input.  The source of energy could be another role in this frame (energy-source), which would be bound to the actor for self-propelled motion, and to an external Causer in the case of CausedMotion.
