{{Frame family}}
Note that the frames included here are both x-schema frames (relating to stages of x-schemas), and ALSO process frames, with the corresponding stages. All the individual process frames should be seen as special cases of the respective x-schema stages. 

What distinguishes x-schema from process is that process additionally has a protagonist role.
