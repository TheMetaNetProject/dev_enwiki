|Comments="The derivation for STATES ARE LOCATIONS would imply that permanent 'states' - i.e., essential properties - should be harder to conceptualize as locations, since our understanding of these properties does not involve change. E.g. ?These cliffs are in/at a state of verticality. ?My dog is in a state of mammalhood." (Grady 1998:p. 107)
