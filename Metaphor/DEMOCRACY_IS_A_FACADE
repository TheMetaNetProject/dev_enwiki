|Description="Interior-exterior" taken out of Source frame
|Comments=There are two dimensions to consider:
1. Whether there is a different interior vs. exterior (facade, farce); whether there is an exterior while having an empty interior (husks, shells); Interior is understood as the 'expected interior' in the relevant frame.

2. Whether the 'fooling' is intentional or not (there is an Evaluation frame).

Source frame is a placeholder.
