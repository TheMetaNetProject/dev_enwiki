|Example.Text=Debt, debt, debt; we're drowning in it. This morning, the Office for National Statistics published the latest estimates of public sector borrowing. Though borrowing is falling faster than anticipated, thanks to the fact that spending cuts are finally beginning to kick in, the national debt has risen to 64.2 per cent of GDP. More significantly, we now owe more than £1 trillion, or around £16,000 for every person in the country.
