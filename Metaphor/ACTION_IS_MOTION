|Comments=What is the appropriate Source frame here?  We are currently using a very general Motion frame (mover could be any type of entity, motion is not necessarily controlled by the mover).  But, is the motion here actually 'animate motion' (i.e. mover is also an actor), with the experiential correlation that most (volitional) actions also involve (volitional) self-initiated/controlled motion?
